Knight Travails:


Project Description:
This project is a search algorithm visualizer using the knight chess piece. The code is written in Python, and the graphics were implemented using the 
Pygame API. Currently the project only has Breadth-Width Search set up, but hopefully in the future I will also add other search algorithms as well. In
this project I learned about Search Algorthims and their full functionality, moreover, incorporating said search algorithms with the knight piece was
not an easy task.


How To Run:
Make sure to install all files and run Main.py


How To Use/Functionality:
You can move the knight piece around by clicking on it once and clicking on another square. To move the green flag click on the green flag button and then
another square. Once you have both set up click the breadth-width search button and then click anywhere on the screen for the simulation to start.
